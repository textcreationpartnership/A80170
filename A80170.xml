            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>HAving formerly ſpent ſome part of my time at Sea, I perceived the Genius and Inclination of moſt Mariners to be affected with drawing ſuch Paper Schemes and Delineations of the Sphere, as might not onely repreſent the ſame to their fancy, but likewiſe ſuit the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſuch Spherique queſtions, as commonly they had occaſion of; and finding a complaint amongſt them of the want of a good Treatiſe of that kinde, I have often wiſhed that ſome of our able Artiſts would diſplay their endeavours to that purpoſe, wherein failing of my deſire, and conſidering that ſome mean performances of this nature have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly found good Acceptance with Seamen, as being ſuitable to the meaneſt Capacity, and performed by a Scale of ſmall bulk and price, I thought fit to impart my Obſervations of that kinde, and certainly to the moſt learned it will be matter of uſe and delight, to ſee that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they can perform by exact Calculation, if their Tables be free from error, may be confirmed and performed without them, by the ſole aſſiſtance of a pair of Compaſſes and a bare Ruler, and what great eaſe enſues, both in Navigation and Dyalling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by skill in carrying on of Proportions Geometrically, is ſcarcely as yet expected or apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe who are ſtrangers thereto.</p>
                  <p>If thou art juſt entring upon the Mathematicals, this Treatiſe may ſerve as an Introduction, in which after thou haſt read to page <hi>20</hi> of the firſt Part, thou mayeſt apply thy ſelf to the Spherical Definitions in the ſecond Part, and there proceed, or elſe where, as ſhall be moſt ſuitable to thy deſires. Thou wilt eaſily perceive that the right Angled Caſes from page <hi>57</hi> to <hi>63,</hi> in the ſecond Book, and alſo from page <hi>2</hi> to <hi>11</hi> in the third Book, might have been contrived in one general Scheme for each Book, but not ſo perſpicuous to be underſtood: If this finde acceptance it will encourage me to be more laborious here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and if thou reap benefit thereby, I have attained my deſire, and that thou mayeſt ſo do, is the hearty wiſh of thy Well-willer and Friend,</p>

                  <p>A <hi>Point,</hi> is an imaginary Prick void of all length, breadth or depth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Line,</hi> is a ſuppoſed Length without breadth or depth, the ends or limits whereof are Points.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An Angle,</hi> derived from the word <hi>Angulus</hi> in Latine, which ſignifieth a Corner, is the inclination or bowing of two lines one to another, and the one touching the other, and not being directly joyned together.</p>
                  <p>If the Lines which contain the Angle be right Lines, then is it called a Right lined Angle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A right Angle,</hi> when a right Line ſtanding upon a right Line, maketh the Angles on either ſide equal, each of theſe Angles are called Right Angles, and the Line erected is called a Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Line unto the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An obtuſe Angle,</hi> is that which is greater then a right Angle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An acute Angle,</hi> is that which is leſs then a right Angle, when tvvo Angles are both acute or obtuſe, they are of the ſame kinde, othervviſe are ſaid to be of different affection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An Angle,</hi> is commonly denoted by the middlemoſt of the three Letters ſet to the ſides, including the ſaid Angle.</p>
                  <p>The quantity of an Angle is meaſured by the arch of a Circle, deſcribed upon the point of Concurrence or Interſection, where the two ſides incloſing the ſaid Angle, meet.</p>
                  <p>By the complement of an Arch or Angle, is meant the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that Arch taken from 90<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, unleſs it be expreſſed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement thereof to a Semicircle of 180<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Circle,</hi> is a plain Figure contained under one Line, which is called the Circumference thereof, by ſome the Perimeter, Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phery, or Limbe, a portion or part thereof is called a Segment.</p>
                  <p>The Center thereof is a Point in the very midſt thereof, from which Point all right lines drawn to the Circumference are equal,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119140:7"/> if divers Circles are deſcribed upon one and the ſame Center, they are ſaid to be Concentrick, if upon divers Centers, they are in reſpect of each other ſaid to be Excentrick.</p>
                  <p>The Diameter of a Circle is a right Line drawn through the Center of any Circle, in ſuch ſort that it may divide the whole Circle into two equal parts.</p>
                  <p>The Semidiameter of a Circle, commonly called the <hi>Radius</hi> thereof, is juſt one half of the Diameter, and is contained betwixt the Center and one ſide of the Circle.</p>
                  <p>A Semicircle is the one medeity or half of a whole Circle, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed upon the Diameter thereof.</p>
                  <p>And a Quadrant is juſt the one fourth of a whole Circle.</p>
                  <p>All Circles are ſuppoſed to be divided into 360 equal parts, called Degrees, conſequently a Semicircle contains 180<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and a Quadrant 90<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and ſo much is the quantity of a right Angle.</p>
                  <p>A Minute is the ſixtieth part of a degree, being underſtood of meaſure, but in time a Minute is the ſixtieth part of an hour, or the fourth part of a degree, 15 degrees anſwering to an hour, and 4 Minutes to a degree. A Minute is marked thus 1′, a ſecond is the ſixtieth part of a Minute, marked thus 1″.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. <hi>The right Sine</hi> of an Arch is half the Chord of twice that Arch: thus G F being the half of G L, is the Sine of the Arch, G A half of the Arch G A L, whence it follows that the right Sine of an Arch leſs then a quadrant, is alſo the right Sine of that Arks reſidue from a Semicircle, becauſe, as was ſhewed above, the Chord of an Ark is the ſame both to an Ark leſſer then a quadrant, and to its complement to a Semicircle.</p>
                        <p>What an Arch wants of a quadrant, is called the Complement thereof: thus the Arch D G is the Complement of the Arch A G, and H G is the Sine of the Arch D G, or which is all one, it is the Coſine of the Arch A G, and the Line H G being equal to C F, it follows that the right Sine of the Complement of an Arch is equal to that part of the Diameter, which lieth between that Arch and the Center.</p>
                        <p>From the former Scheme alſo follows another Definition of a right Sine, as namely, that it is a right Line falling from one end of any Arch perpendicularly upon the Radius, drawn to the other end of the ſaid Arch, ſo is G F perpendicular to C A, being the Sine of the Arch G A; likewiſe A I falls perpendicularly on C G, therefore by the ſame definition is alſo the Sine of the ſaid Arch.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>The Verſed Sine</hi> of an Arch is that part of the Diameter which lieth between the right Sine of that Arch and the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: thus F A is the Verſed Sine of the Arch G A, and F B the Verſed Sine of the Arch B D G.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If unto one end of an Arch there be drawn a Radius, and to the other end a right line from the Center, cutting the Circle, and if from the end of the Radius a Perpendicular be raiſed till it meet with the Line cutting the Circle, that Perpendicular is the Tangent of that Arch: thus A E is the Tangent of the Arch G A, and D M is the Cotangent of the ſaid Ark, namely, it is the Tangent of the Arch H G, which is the Complement of the former Arch.</p>

                           <pb n="12" facs="tcp:119140:12"/>5. The aforeſaid right Line cutting the Circle, is called the Secant of the ſaid Arch: thus C E is the Secant of the Arch G A, and C M is the Coſecant of the ſaid Arch, for it is the Secant of the Arch D G.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Aſſigning the Radius C A to be an unit with Ciphers at pleaſure, to define or expreſs the quantities of theſe reſpective lines, in relation to the Arches to which they belong, were to make a Table of natural Sines, Tangents and Secants; of which at large ſee Mr. <hi>Newtons Trigonometria Brittanica,</hi> for abbreviate ways, and ſomething we ſhall adde about it in the Arithmetical part of Navigation.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The Tables being made, their chief uſe was to work the Rule of Three, or Golden Rule Arithmetically, by multiplying the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third tearms of any Proportion, and dividing by the firſt, and thereby to reſolve all Propoſitions relating either to Plain or Spherical Triangles, which in lines is performed by drawing a line parallel to the Side of a Triangle, and where four tearms either in Sines, Tangents, Secants, Verſed Sines, are expreſſed, as the firſt to the ſecond, ſo is the third to the fourth, it implyes a Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the ſecond and third tearm are to be multiplyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the Product divided by the firſt.</p>
                        <p>The proportion or reaſon of two numbers, or reference of one to the other, is meaſured by the Quotient, the one being divided by the other.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A Proportion</hi> is then ſaid to be direct, when the third tearm bears ſuch proportion to the fourth, as the firſt to the ſecond: four num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are ſaid to be proportional when as often as the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond are the one contained in the other, ſo often are the third and fourth the one contained in the other.</p>

                           <hi>Reciprocal Proportion</hi> is when the fourth tearm bears ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the third, as the firſt doth to the ſecond.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A Proportion</hi> is ſaid to hold <hi>alternately,</hi> when the ſecond and third tearms thereof change places, and <hi>inverſly,</hi> when the order of the tearms are ſo altered, that one of the three firſt tearms ſhall become the laſt.</p>
                        <p>Divers Proportions are expreſſed in this following Book, which if the Reader would apply to Tables, he muſt underſtand that when a Side or an Angle is greater then a Quadrant, that in ſtead of the

                        <p>That the Coſine or Cotangent of an Arch greater then a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, is the Sine or Tangent of the exceſs of that Arch above a Quadrant, or 90 degrees.</p>

                     <p>Having firſt drawn the quadrant B F C, with the Radius, or 60 degrees of the Chords, then prick the Chord of the Latitude 51 degrees 32 minutes from B to L, and draw C L produced: prick the Chord of the Atitude, to wit, 41 degrees 34 minutes, from B to A, prick the Chord of the Declination 23 degrees 31 minutes in ſummer, from F upwards to D, but in winter downwards in the arch of the quadrant continued, and draw D E parallel to C F, the neareſt diſtance from A to C F, is the Coſine of the Altitude, which place on the Latitude line, from C to H, ſo is C H the ſecant of the Latitude, the neareſt diſtance from H to C F being Radius, which extent place from C to K.</p>
                     <p>Then place the arch A L from B to G, and the neareſt diſtance from G to E D is the difference of the verſed Sines of the third tearm of the Proportion; it is alſo by reaſon of the Proportion of equality, the verſed Sine of the Azimuth from the North, which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119140:23"/> place from C to M, then becauſe it is greater then the Radius C K, the Azimuth is more then 90 degrees from the North, and K M is the Sine of the Azimuth from the Eaſt or Weſt, wherewith on the point K deſcribe the ark O, and a ruler from the Center touching it, cuts the Limbe at Q, and the arch F Q being 15 degrees, is the Suns Azimuth to the Southwards of Eaſt or Weſt, whereas if the point M had fallen as much on the other ſide K, it had been ſo much to the Northwards of it.</p>
                     <p>This is an excellent Scheme, in regard it requires the drawing of no new Lines till the Declination vary.</p>
                     <p>The Coſine of the Altitude may be multiplied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, it reacheth to I, the Radius, to wit, C K doubled reacheth to L, the extent C M being doubled, reacheth to N, with L N de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Ark P, and a ruler from the Center, touching its extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, finds the Point Q in the Limbe, as before.</p>

                     <p>Having with 60 degrees of the Chords, deſcribed a Semicircle A D B, draw the Diameter A C B, perpendicular thereto from the Center raiſe C D, prick off the Latitude from A to L, and draw the Latitude line L M parallel to D C, prick off the height from D to H, and place the Sine thereof being the nearſt diſtance from H to D C, from L to N place the Chord of the Suns Polar diſtance, to wit 77 degrees, from N to P, and ſetting one foot on M, with the extent M P, deſcribe an Ark, then take the Coſine of the Altitude being the neareſt diſtance from H to A C, and upon C as a Center, deſcribe another Ark which croſſeth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer at S, a Ruler from the Center over S, cuts the Limbe at V, and the Arch A V being 110<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, is the Suns Azimuth from the North.</p>

                     <p>If the Sun have Depreſſion, the Sine of it muſt be pricked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward above L in the Latitude Line, and then as before.</p>

In South Latitudes when the Altitude is very great, the interſections of the prickt Arks will fall near the Center, in that caſe let the Altitude and Latitude change Names, and fit the Scheme thereto: Here note, that the three points M C S are the angular points of the Sides of a plain Triangle, &amp; if thoſe Sides be doubled (doubling the ſine M C outward beyond M) the interſection at S which now hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pens within the Semicircle, would happen without and beyond it: The foundation of this Scheme ſhall afterwards be ſuggeſted.</p>

                     <p>From any two points in the Sphere, ſuppoſe Perpendiculars to fall on the plain of the Equator here repreſented by AE L Q M, which Perpendiculars are the Sines of the Latitudes of thoſe two Points, and the diſtance of the points in the Plain of the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial from the Center of the Sphere, are the Coſines of thoſe Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, &amp; the angle at the Center between thoſe points in the plain of the Equator, is equal to the arch of the Equinoctial between the two Meridians, paſſing through the ſuppoſed Points in the Sphere: now a right line extended in the Sphere between any two Points, is the Chord of the Ark of diſtance between thoſe Points.</p>
                     <p>Underſtand then, that the three Points A, C, B, limit the Sides of a righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And if the extent E D, E G, be placed from L to H and K, the line D E G need not be drawn, becauſe the extent L G and L D, if it be rightly conceived, are the two very Points at firſt ſuppoſed in the Sphere, the extent A B as to matter of Calculation, being one Side of a plain Triangle right angled. The ſum or difference of the Sines of both Latitudes the other Side, and the Chord of the diſtance is the Hipotenuſal, or third Side ſought.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Ancients by Calculation, and we by Protraction, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two Sides and the Angle comprehended given, find the third Side; or having three Sides given, find the Angle oppoſite to that Side which in the Scheme is meaſured by a Chord, as by reſult from the three Sides there will be got the two extents A E

                     <p>Having deſcribed a Semicircle, and divided it into halfs by the Perpendicular H C, prick the Latitude from S to L, and draw L A parallel to S N, and proportion out the Sine of 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to the Radius L A, and prick it from A to 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, upon which point with the Sine of the Declination, deſcribe a prickt Circle, and a ruler from the Center juſt touching the outward extreamities of it, cuts the Limbe at T and K: Here note, that H C is the Horizontal line and any Ark counted from H towards K is Altitude, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards N is Depreſſion; ſo in this Example the Arch H K being 49<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 56′, is the Altitude for 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of Azimuth to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the Eaſt and Weſt for North Declination, and the Arch H T being 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 36′, is the Suns Depreſſion under the Horizon for the ſame Azimuth, when his Declination is 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 31′ South.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo his Altitude for 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of Azimuth to the North-wards of the Eaſt or Weſt, when his Declination is 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 31′ North, becauſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119140:30"/> if we place A 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi> as much on the other ſide the Vertical at M, and with the Sine of the Declination deſcribe an Ark at <hi>f,</hi> a ruler from the Center will cut the Limbe as much on this ſide H, as T is on the other ſide.</p>
                     <p>If the prickt Circle had hapned wholly on one ſide C H, a ruler from the Center touching its extreamities, and cutting the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circle in two points, that neareſt unto H had been the Altitude to the aſſigned Azimuth for South Declination, and the remoteſt for North Declination.</p>
                     <p>And if one Side of the prickt Circle happens below S C, as it may do both for the Sun or Stars, when their Declination is more then the Latitude of the place, then the Quadrant H S. muſt be continued to a Semicircle, and H C muſt be alſo produced, and the Altitude counted above the other end of the ſaid Horizontal Line.</p>
                     <p>If the ruler ſhould touch the prickt Circle near the Center, let it be noted that C 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi> is the Radius, and the extent that deſcribed the prickt Circle, is a Sine of an Ark to that Radius; whence it followes, that a right angled Triangle may be framed, and the anſwer given in the Limbe, as we have often done before. See the laſt Scheme for finding the Amplitude.</p>
                     <p>The Demonſtration of this Scheme, is founded not onely on the Analemma, as I have ſaid in the Second Part, but likewiſe on thoſe Proportions, whereby the Suns Altitudes are Calculated on all Azimuths.</p>

                     <p>In the former Scheme L A is the Radius of a line of Sines, it is alſo the Cotangent of the Latitude, if we make C A Radius.</p>
                     <p>Then becauſe of the Proportion of Equality in the two firſt tearmes, it followes that the ſine of the Azimuth from the Vertical A 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, to the Radius L A, is alſo the Tangent of the Equinoctial Altitude, making C A Radius, wherefore a ruler over C 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi> cuts the Limbe at B, and the Ark H B being 21<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 40′, is the Equinoctial Altitude ſought.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Art of Navigation.</head>
                  <p>THe end of this Art, is to ſhew how a Ship is to be ſteered and guided, that at length ſhe may arrive at the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Port.</p>
                  <p>The Imperfections and Defects of this Art are many, partly in the skill or theorick, partly in the practice.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Principles, or in the Theorick, a great defect is, that the true Longitudes of Places are not yet known, and unleſs the true Longitudes and Latitudes of Places be known, their true Courſes and Diſtances cannot be found, whence it will unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably follow, that no true reckoning can be kept.</p>
                  <p>After a long Voyage, when a Ship is ſuppoſed to be a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent diſtance, or not very far off the main Land, it is a uſual cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Maſter to require from his Mates an account of their judgement concerning the bearing and diſtance of ſome Cape or Head-land which they may make, or gain ſight of, and in the event he that gives the beſt judgement, is ſuppoſed to have kept the beſt reckoning; and this may be admitted of, provided they were all at firſt agreed concerning the true Courſe and Diſtance of the Place they ſhall firſt eſpie, from that place from which they were bound, otherwiſe a bad reckoning in the reſult may prove better then a good one, in reſpect of the uncertainty in the Longitude: I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> and others have made ſuch grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Complaints as theſe.</p>
                  <p>That there is 150 or 200 Leagues error in the diſtance between the <hi>Bay of Mexico</hi> and the <hi>Azores,</hi> and in ſome Charts about 600 Leagues error in the diſtance between <hi>Cape Mendoſino</hi> and <hi>Cape California,</hi> which great errors are partly to be aſcribed to the uncertainty of Longitude, and partly to the Plain Chart, which makes Places far more diſtant then they would be, and ſituated much out of their true Rumbe.</p>
                  <p>Another uncertainty there is in keeping the Ship ſteered upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119140:36"/> the true Rumbe, albeit it were known, for the Wyres of the Needle being touched by the Load-ſtone, are ſubject to be drawn aſide by any Iron near it, and liable to variation, and doth not ſhew the true North and South, which ought continually to be obſerved and allowed for, as I have ſaid.</p>
                  <p>And moreover in one and the ſame Region or Place, doth not exactly ſhew the ſame Rumbe or Courſe, as is well known to Dyalliſts, by their Experiments in obſerving the Situation of a Wall; thereby <hi>Maetius</hi> ſaith, he ſometimes found a degree or two difference, and Mr. <hi>Gunter</hi>'s Experiments at <hi>Limehouſe,</hi> for finding the variation, made it in ſome places of the ſame ground more by half a degree then in other places, and in ſome other places leſs, which may be thus illuſtrated.</p>
                  <p>Let a Sea-Compaſs, or rather a Box and Needle, be faſtened upon a Surveying Inſtrument, ſo that the Needle may exactly point to ſome mark or graduation in the Box, whereto it may be afterwards ſet, and then looking through the Sights of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, obſerve what mark, as Tree, Tower, Building, or the like, appears in view to the eye, and if there be no ſuch mark, then a Staff may be ſet up at a competent diſtance, then move the Field-Inſtrument round, that the Needle may totter and be unſetled, but the Sights not altered, and afterwards in the ſame place let it ſettle it ſelf to point out the very ſame Point or mark in the Box, as it did before, then if you look through the former ſights, the mark ſet up will not appear in the ſame viſual line to the eye, as before, but on one ſide or the other.</p>
                  <p>And if there be ſo much uncertainty on the firm Land; how much more in the floating Sea, where the Ship may be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with ſecret and unknown Currents; for the finding out whereof it will be neceſſary for the Maſters and Mates when they ſee any Iſland or Land, to obſerve which way the ripples of water uſe to ſet: It will alſo be very advantagious to obſerve the uſual cuſtoms of the Winds, called <hi>A Trade Wind,</hi> which many times cauſeth the Sea to have a Courſe or Current therewith, as <hi>Maetius</hi> inſtanceth by an Example between <hi>Braſilia</hi> and <hi>Angola,</hi> in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Coaſt of <hi>Africa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the tenth of <hi>April</hi> to the tenth of <hi>July,</hi> the Current ſets North-weſt.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:119140:36"/>
                  <p>From the tenth of <hi>July</hi> to the tenth of <hi>October,</hi> it ſeems to have no motion.</p>
                  <p>From the tenth of <hi>October</hi> to the tenth of <hi>January,</hi> it ſets South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt.</p>
                  <p>And from the tenth of <hi>January</hi> to the tenth of <hi>April,</hi> it ſeems to have no motion again.</p>
                  <p>Another Inſtance of the uncertainty in a reckoning by reaſon of Currents, may be taken from <hi>Davis</hi> his <hi>Streights,</hi> where the Sea flows with ſuch a violent, ſecret, or undiſcerned force, that thoſe which ſteer from thence Eaſt by the Compaſs, do finde they have made their Courſe South-eaſt, which is a ſufficient Inſtance of the danger and uncertainty of Navigation, for when a Ship ſteers but one Rumbe, or 11<hi rend="sup">d</hi> ¼ from the true Courſe, in the ſpace of an hundred Leagues, ſhe ſhall fall wide of expectation almoſt ten Leagues, or 1/10 of the diſtance, which in four Rumbes error will amoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>

                  <p>And where ſuch Currents are if you ſtem them, the diſtance run will be leſs then it is by Eſtimation, but if you ſayl with them, it will be much more, and proportionally it will be leſs or more, if you croſs it eitheir directly or obliquely, according as it ſets with or againſt your intended Courſe.</p>

                  <p>Whereto we may adde, that the Refraction of the Sun, eſpecially in Winter, makes his Altitude or Height ſeem greater then it is, which is cauſed by the groſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and thickneſs of the Air near the Horizon, this we may allude to after this manner: Set down an empty Baſon on a Stool, laying a ſhilling at the bottom thereof, and go ſo much backwards, till you bring the edge of the Baſon and the ſhilling in a right line with your Eye, and then let another fill the Baſon with fair water, and you may go a pretty way further backward, and ſtill ſee the ſhilling and the edge of the Baſon in a right line, the refraction of the water being the cauſe thereof; and from this Reaſon we conclude, That the Sun ſeems to appear above the Horizon when he is really ſet.</p>
                  <p>This is confirmed alſo by many Experiments, we may recite one: A certain Dutch Ship being upon the Diſcovery of a North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt paſſage to the <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> was conſtrained to winter in the Iſland of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> where after the Sun had been for divers moneths under the Horizon, the Mariners beheld the whole body of the Sun iuſt above the Horizon 14 days ſooner then according to his Declination he ſhould appeare, and by Computation was then at leaſt 5 degrees under the Horizon; Alſo at other times, eſpecially in winter, he appears to be higher then he is, for which there are Tables of Allowance, as alſo for the Parralax and height of the eye in <hi>Mr. Wrights Correction of Errors in Navigation,</hi> wherefore thoſe that come from the South-wards, expecting to fall in with the <hi>Lands-end,</hi> or <hi>Lizard,</hi> are to be admoniſhed that in truſting to the Obſerved Latitude, they do not eſtimate themſelves more to the Southwards then really they are, and ſo incur danger through preſumption; but this erro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Our Engliſh or Italian Mile by which we reckon at Sea, contains 1000 paces, and each pace five foot, and every foot 12 inches. The 120<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of that Mile is 41⅔ feet, and ſo much is the ſpace betweene the Knots upon the Log-line: So many Knots as the Ship runs in half a minute, ſo many Miles ſhe ſayleth in an hour; or ſo many Leagues, and ſo many Miles ſhe runneth in a Watch or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119140:40"/> four hours, called <hi>A Watch,</hi> becauſe one half of the Ships Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany watcheth by turns, and changes every four hours.</p>

                     <p>Every Noon the Maſter and his Mates take the reckoning off the Log-board, and double the Knots run, and then divide the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which is the number of Miles run by three, the quotient is the Leagues run ſince the former Noon, and according to cuſtom the Log is thrown every two hours, and I never knew the courſe nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer expreſſed on the Log-board, then to half a point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Norwood</hi> in his excellent Book, called, <hi>The Sea-mans Practiſe,</hi> ſheweth, That according to a late exact Experiment of his, which ſeemes to be very ſatisfactory, and confirmed by many other Experiments, that in ordinary Practiſe at Sea we cannot, if we will yield Truth the conqueſt, allow leſs then 360000 of our Engliſh feet to vary one degree of Latitude upon the earth, in ſayling North or South under any Meridian, according to which account there will be in a degree of our Statute meaſure 68 2/1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Miles, each Mile containing 5280 feet, and of the common Sea-meaſure, allowing 5000 feet to a Mile, there will be 72 Miles, or 24 Leagues in a degree, which we ſhall take to be the truth.</p>
                     <p>A reckoning being kept in degrees, and Centeſms or hundredth parts of a degree, is a ready way, and well approved by Mr. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> in his ſaid <hi>Sea-mans Practiſe;</hi> as alſo by Mr. <hi>Phillips</hi> in his <hi>Geometrical Seaman,</hi> who wholly uſeth this meaſure, and yet the Mariner may very well refrain this meaſure, if he will keep his reckoning in Leagues and tenths, as I ſhall afterwards ſhew. Now to ſhew this meaſure, the Logline muſt have a knot placed at every 30 foot length, and as many of thoſe as run out in half a Minute, ſo many Centeſms or hundredth parts of a degree the ſhip ſayleth in an hour, and for every three foot more you are to allow the tenth part of a Centeſm, or the one thouſandth part of a degree.</p>
                     <p>But if you would have it to ſhew the Miles of a true degree, allowing but 60 to a degree, the mile muſt be enlarged propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, and the diſtance between every one of the Knots muſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119140:40"/> be 50 foot and as many of thoſe as run out in half Minute, ſo many Miles or Minutes the ſhip ſaileth in an hour, and for every foot more you muſt allow the tenth part of a mile more and if Sea-men be deſirous to retain their former cuſtom of reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhips way in Leagues, then muſt either the ſaid reckoning be reduced into degrees and Centeſms of degrees by Arithmetick, becauſe the degrees of Latitude on the Plain Chart, and of Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Latitude on <hi>Mercators Chart</hi> are divided, and that moſt conveniently into 10 parts, and each part ſuppoſed to be divided into 10 more, or elſe ſuch a Scale of equal parts over and above muſt be added to each Chart, wherein a degree of Latitude in the Plain Chart, and of Longitude in <hi>Mercators Chart,</hi> muſt be divided into 20 equal parts, and the labor of reducing by the Pen, will be ſaved; or the adding of any ſuch Scale, may very well be ſpared and otherwiſe ſupplied, as I ſhall afterwards ſhew.</p>

                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p n="2">2. Leagues and their Decimals parts, are reduced into degrees and Centeſmes, by ſeparating one figure from the whole Leagues towards the left hand, and dividing the whole by 2.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example.</hi>

                     <p>On the contrary degrees and centeſms are deduced into Leagues,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119140:41"/> and their Decimal parts, by placing the Comma after the firſt Decimal part, toward the right hand, and then multiplying the whole by two: thus the former number of degrees are to be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed 135, 9 which multiplyed by two, makes 271 <g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>8 leagues, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Minutes, whereof there are 60 in a degree, are reduced into Centeſimals by annexing a Cipher thereto, and dividing by 6: thus 27 Minutes with a Cipher, make 270, which divided by 6, gives in the quotient 45 Centeſms, here after 27 was divided by 6, the quotient was 4, and 3 remaining with the Cipher is 30, which divided by 6, the quotient is 5.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, the Centeſmes of a degree are reduced into Minutes, by multiplying them by 6, and cutting off the laſt figure: thus, 75 Centeſmes multiplyed by 6, make 450, which is 45 minutes.</p>
                     <p>This trouble, as I ſaid before, is taken away by fitted Scales by the View onely, if they ſtand back to back, as in the Scales of equal parts on the Plain Scale, where 75 Centeſmes in the leſſer Scale of equal parts, ſtands againſt 45 parts or Minutes in the greater Scale of equal parts, and thus when the Latitudes of two places are given in degrees and minutes, the minutes are to be turned or reduced into Centeſmes.</p>
                     <p>And ſo in the example of the former Chart, the line A B con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 10 degrees, is divided into 20 parts, and one of thoſe parts into 10 others, which I call, <hi>The Scale of Leagues of a true degree,</hi> then becauſe the whole diſtance T N is too long to be meaſured at once, I firſt meaſure 10 degrees or 200 Leagues from T to C, and then C N meaſured on the Leagues, is 71 leagues and eight tenths more, and on the centeſimal degrees, is 3 degrees 59 Centeſmes.</p>
                     <p>So that the whole diſtance is 271 Leagues eight tenths, or 13 degrees 59 Centeſmes, which is thus expreſſed 13<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 59: or thus, 13<hi rend="sup">d</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. An experienced judgement in eſtimating the Ships way in her Courſe upon every ſhift of Wind, allowing for Leeward-way and Currents.</p>

                     <p>The reckoning ariſing out of the two former Branches, is called the <hi>Dead Reckoning,</hi> and of theſe three Branches there ought to be ſuch an harmony and conſent, that any two being given, a third Concluſion may be thence raiſed with truth.</p>
                     <p>As namely, from the Courſe and diſtance, to find the Latitude of the Ships place.</p>
                     <p>Or by the Courſe and difference of Latitude, to finde the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; or by the difference of Latitude and diſtance, to finde the Courſe: But in the midſt of ſo many uncertainties that daily occur in the practiſe of Navigation, a joynt Conſent in theſe three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars is hardly to be expected, and when an error ariſeth, the ſole remedy to be truſted to, is the obſervation of the Latitude, or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119140:46"/> the known Soundings when a Ship is near land, and how to rectifie the Reckoning by the obſerved latitude, we ſhall now ſhew.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that will not yeild unto truth in this particular, that a bout 24 of our common Engliſh Sea leagues are to be allowed to vary a degree of latitude under the Meridian, do put themſelves into a double incapacity.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in ſailing directly North or South under the Meridian where there is no Current, finding their Reckoning to fall ſhort of the obſerved latitude, they take it to be an error in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in concluding the Ships way by Eſtimation or gueſs to be too little.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, if there be a Current that helps ſet them forward, that there is a near agreement between the obſerved and the dead latitude, they conclude there is no ſuch Current.</p>
                     <p>Or laſtly, if they ſtem the Current, they conclude it to be much ſwifter then in truth it is, and thus one error commonly begets another, but ſuppoſing a conformity to the truth, we ſhall preſcribe four Precepts for correcting a ſimple or ſingle Courſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prec.</hi> I. Firſt therfore, if a ſhip ſail under the Meridian, if the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of latitude be leſs by eſtimation then it is by obſervation, the Ships place or Variation onely is to be corrected and enlarged under the Meridian, and the error i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to be imputed either to the judgement in gueſſing at the diſtance run, in making it too little, or if the ſaid diſtance be gueſſed at by a ſound and experienced judgement, you may ſuppoſe you ſtem ſome Current.</p>
                     <p>So if a Ship ſaile from A in the latitude of 28<hi rend="sup">d</hi> directly South 48, ſuch leagues whereof 20 are a degree, the difference of lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is 2 degrees 24 minutes, each league being 3 minutes, by this eſtimate the Ship ſhould be at B, but if the obſerved latitude be but 25 degrees, the reckoning being amended, the Ships place is at the point D, and in this Scheme we have made every degree of latitude to be twice as large as it was in the former Chart, and ſo the degrees of latitude in that Chart will become a Scale of leagues to this.</p>
                     <p>But if the difference of latitude be more by Eſtimation, then it is by obſervation, either the judgement erres in ſuppoſing the diſtance run to be too much: in this caſe the diſtance is to be ſhortned, and the Ships place corrected, according to the obſerved
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119140:46"/> latitude under the Meridian; ſo if a ſhip ſayle South from A in the Latitude of 28<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, till ſhe hath varied her latitude 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 24′ by Eſtimation, being at the Point B in the latitude of 25<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 36′, if the obſerved latitude be 26<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, the Ships place being corrected by this Obſervation, will be in the Point E, and not at B.</p>
                     <p>Or if you can preſume upon the truth of your judgement, and finde it ſo to happen, commonly that the diſtance run is more then you can make it by obſervation, you may well ſuppoſe you croſs ſome Current which ſets either Eaſtward or Weſtward, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell which until you come near ſome Land, to ſee which way the ripples of Water ſet, or are informed by the experience of others.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Precept</hi> II. But ſuppoſing no Current, if the ſhip ſayl upon one of the five Rumbes next the Meridian, if the <hi>Dead Latitude</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the <hi>Obſerved Latitude,</hi> the error is in miſ-judging the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance run, which is either to be enlarged or ſhortned, as the caſe requires.</p>
                     <p>In the former Scheme, ſuppoſe a ſhip ſayl from A South-weſt and by South 48 leagues, being by eſtimation at C in the latitude of 26<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, but if the latitude by obſervation be but 25<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 36′, ſuppoſe at B, then a line drawn through B, parallel to A W, croſſeth the line of the ſhips courſe at M, which is the corrected Point where the ſhip is, and hereby the Diſtance is enlarged, the extent A M being 57, 7 leagues, that is 57 leagues, and a little above two mile more.</p>
                     <p>In like manner if the Ship had ſayled about 72 leagues on that courſe, and were by eſtimation at the Point G in the latitude of 25<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and by the obſervation the latitude were found to be 25<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 36′, in this caſe the ſhips diſtance is to be ſhortned, by drawing the aforeſaid line B M parallel to A W, which croſſeth the line of the ſhips courſe at M, which is now the corrected Point of the ſhips place.</p>
                     <p>Either of theſe Inſtances may be performed on the Chart, by finding out the ſeparation or weſtwardly diſtance proper to the corrected latitude without drawing any lines, and that by help of the Traverſe-Quadrant, <hi>page</hi> 13. in which C B there, is made equal to A B the difference of latitude here, then in the ſaid
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119140:47"/> Quadrant either raiſe a Perpendicular from that point, cutting the third Rumbe, or enter the ſaid extent on the third Rumbe, ſo that one foot reſting therein, as at D, the other turned about will but juſt touch C W, then the neareſt diſtance from D to C S, is the ſeparation required, which in this Chart is to be placed from A to L, being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he ſeparation corrected, whereas the dead ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion need not be known or found at all.</p>
                     <p>But in theſe caſes, if the judgement ſuppoſe there is ſome Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and can depend upon the obſerved difference of Latitude and dead Diſtance, as both true, then the Departure from the Meridian may be found, as in the laſt caution of the former Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, whereby the error will be imputed to the Rumbe, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by reaſon of the ſuppoſed Current.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Precept</hi> III. But in Rumbes near the Eaſt or Weſt, if the dead latitude differ from the obſerved latitude, the error is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted either wholly to the Rumbe, or partly to the Rumbe, partly to the Diſtance.</p>
                     <p>If wholly to the Rumbe, then retain the obſerved difference of latitude, and the eſtimated diſtance, and finde the Separation or Departure from the Meridian, as was done in the laſt Caution of the firſt Caſe or Precept.</p>
                     <p>But if the judgement would allot the error partly to the Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be, partly to the Diſtance, retain the obſerved difference of lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and for the Departure from the Meridian, let it be the ſame as it was made by the Dead Reckoning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So if a ſhip ſayl Weſt and by South half a point Southerly 68, 9 leagues, that is 68 leagues and nine tenths, from the latitude of 28<hi rend="sup">d</hi> from A to H, and by the Dead Reckoning ſhould be in the latitude of 27<hi rend="sup">d</hi>; if the latitude by obſervation be 27<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 20′, which will happen at the point I: In this caſe, if the error were wholly imputed to the diſtance, the line I K being drawn parallel to A W, would cut off and ſhorten the diſtance as much as the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of K H, which is 23 leagues, which becauſe it ſeems abſurd and improbable, is not to be admitted of; wherefore imputing the error to the Rumbe onely, place one foot of the extent A H in I, and with the other croſs the line A W at T, and ſo is A T
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119140:48"/> the Departure from the Meridian required, whereby the Rumbe line, if it were drawn, would be altered to paſs through the croſs at <hi>a.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But according to the laſt Caution of this Precept, if you judge the error to be partly in the Rumbe, and partly in the Diſtance, prick the Departure by the Dead Reckoning F H, from A to V, and ſo by help of the points of Variation I, and Separation V, you may draw a new Rumbe line, and finde the quantity thereof; as alſo of the ſhortned diſtance by the direction for platting a Traverſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Precept</hi> IV. If a Ship ſayl directly Eaſt or Weſt, and the dead and obſerved Latitude do both agree, the Reckoning cannot be corrected.</p>
                     <p>But if they differ, the error is either partly in the Rumbe, and partly in the Diſtance, in which caſe retaining the Separation or Weſtwardly Diſtance the ſame, the difference of Latitude is the Variation required, whereby a new Rumbe-line might be drawn if it were needful.</p>
                     <p>But if by frequent obſervation you finde the Ship is ſtill carried from the Eaſt or Weſt, either Northwards or Southwards, you may conclude ſome Current to be the cauſe thereof, in which caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the diſtance to be the ſame it was by the Dead Reckoning, and the difference of Latitude to be the ſame you found it by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, finde the Departure from the Meridian by former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, whereby the Ships Rumbe or Courſe might be drawn if it were needful: It is not neceſſary to preſs Examples, if what before is written be well underſtood, eſpecially in this caſe where all directions are ſlippery.</p>
                     <p>Thus in imitation of <hi>Maetius</hi> a Hollander, though a Latine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, we have preſcribed ſeveral rules for the correction of a ſingle Courſe, which Mr. <hi>Phillips</hi> in his <hi>Geometrical Sea-man</hi> makes but one rule, retaining always the ſame Courſe, and correcting the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance run therein, by drawing a parallel through the obſerved La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and ſo for many Courſes they are firſt brought all into one line, and the diſtance corrected by the ſame rule.</p>
                     <p>But concerning it, we muſt give a double Caution: Firſt, that no three places can be laid down true in their Courſes and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances from each other on the Plain Chart, as ſhall afterwards be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119140:48"/> handled, however the error in ſmall diſtances will be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly admitting they could, the ſaid general Direction is unſound, but the nearer the truth the nearer the Courſes are to the Meridian, and when all the Courſes do either increaſe or diminiſh the Latitude, but very erronious when ſome Courſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and others leſſen the Latitude; in all which Caſes it is moſt ſafe to allot to the Variation or dead Difference of Latitude, of every Courſe its proportional ſhare of the whole error between the Dead and Obſerved Latitude, and then to correct each courſe by the former directions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore in the following Chart, let us ſuppoſe a Ship to ſayl from A in the Latitude of 28<hi rend="sup">d</hi> South South-weſt, almoſt 65 leagues to B, this Courſe is ſet off in the Arch E F, and by the Dead Reckoning ſhe ſhould now be in the Latitude of 25<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</p>
                     <p>Again, from B ſhe ſayls South-weſt and by Weſt 72 leagues to C, which Courſe being three points from the Weſt, is ſet off in the Arch G H, and now by the dead Reckoning ſhe ſhould be in the Latitude of 23 degrees, whereas by a good obſervation ſhe is found to be in the Latitude of 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 30′; wherefore to correct this Reckoning draw the line C A, which is the compound Courſe ariſing from the two former Courſes, and through the parallel of obſerved Latitude, draw L K parallel to A W, ſo is the point K the corrected point of the Ships place, according to Mr. <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips,</hi> and agreeing with the truth, as we have fitted the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                     <p>But now as to the other way of correcting a compound Courſe, it is to be done by this Proportion.</p>
                     <p>Firſt finde the Variation or Difference of Latitude proper to each Courſe, then it holds:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As the ſum of all the Variations or Differences of Latitude:</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Is to the whole error between the Dead and Obſerved Latitude</hi> ∷</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>So is each particular Difference of Latitude:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To its proportional ſhare of the whole error</hi> ∷</p>
                     <figure>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:119140:49"/>
                     </figure>
                     <p>Then if the differences of Latitude fall all the ſame way, if the the eſtimated difference of Latitude be too much, you muſt abate out of each dead Latitude its proportional error, ſo in this caſe the ſaid error is prickt from E to N.</p>
                     <p>But when the eſtimated difference of Latitude is too little, the proportional error muſt be added to each difference of Latitude, then prick the ſecond dead difference of Latitude being equal to E S, from N to O, and place the ſaid extent from A the Center,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119140:49"/> to Y, and take the neareſt diſtance to M A as before, and prick it from O to L, being the ſecond error: this is needful when there are more Courſes then two, but for the laſt Courſe not at all neceſſary, neither is it for this; then through the point N draw the line N F parallel to A W, ſo is F the corrected Point of the Ships place at the firſt Courſe, then draw F K parallel to B C, and where the parallel of Latitude cuts it as at K, is the corrected Point of the Ships place at the ſecond Courſe, being the ſame we found it before the other way.</p>
                     <p>But in ſtead of the ſecond Courſe and diſtance, which was 72 Leagues South-weſt and by weſt, let us now ſuppoſe the Ship ſayls the ſame diſtance from the point B North-weſt and by weſt, which Courſe being as much on the other ſide the weſt, make G I equal to G H, and draw the Courſe B I, therein pricking off the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſtance to D, ſo is D the point of the Ships dead reckoning in the Latitude of 27<hi rend="sup">d</hi>; and now ſuppoſing the obſerved Latitude to be 27<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 30′, the error and difference of Latitude are as much now as they were before; wherefore draw D A the compound rumbe: draw Q T parallel to A W, &amp; where it cuts the compound rumbe as at P, by M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>Phillips</hi> his reckoning, is the corrected point of the Ships place at the end of the ſecond Courſe, whereas in truth it ſhould happen at T, and ſo P bears from A, in this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple 76<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 43′ from the Meridian, and is diſtant from it 43 Leagues and a half, whereas the Ships true Courſe from A to T, is 83<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 32′ from the Meridian, and the diſtance almoſt 89 leagues, which is very conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Now for as much as the Sum of the differences of Latitude A E and E <hi>f,</hi> in this latter example, is equal to A S in the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, alſo the error <hi>f</hi> Q here, is equal to S L there, therefore the proportional part of each error will be the ſame as before.</p>
                     <p>Then if ſome Courſes decreaſe the Latitude Southwardly, and others increaſe it North-wardly, if the dead Latitude be too little, as in this example, conſider that to place the Ship more North-wardly, ſo as to allot to each difference of Latitude its proper error, that the South-wardly differences of Latitude muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed or leſſened, and the North-wardly increaſed; wherefore the proportion of the error is placed from E to N, and the Point F found as before.</p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:119140:50"/>
                     <p>In like manner, if the dead Latitude were too much to bring the Ship more South-wardly, the Southern differences of Latitude muſt be increaſed, and the Northern decreaſed, now the point T is found by drawing a line from F the corrected point of the firſt Courſe, parallel to B D, and ſo the line F V being equal to B D, is the Ships ſecond Courſe and diſtance from the corrected point F, then in regard part of the error in the Latitude is ſuppoſed to be committed, as well in the latter as in the former Courſe, which error being too little, the diſtance F V is to be enlarged, and where the parallel of obſerved Latitude cuts it, as at T, is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected point of the Ships place at the end of the ſecond Courſe.</p>
                     <p>And though what we have here performed be done by the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many Lines, yet by help of the Traverſe-quadrant it may may be inſerted into the Chart, without drawing any Lines therein at all, for in each the Courſe and corrected Difference of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is given; and that two things are ſufficient to diſpatch the work, we have ſhewed before.</p>

                        <hi>Horn Sound</hi> and <hi>Fogg bay</hi> being laid down true as to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Latitude and Longitude, the Courſe between them by the Plain Chart is 68<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 11′ from the Meridian, and the diſtance 1424 Leagues.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If they be laid down true (as they may be) in their Courſe, diſtance, and difference of Latitude, then the difference of Longitude will be falſe, conſequently the difference of Longitude between thoſe two places thus laid down, ſhould be but 27<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 17′, whereas in truth it ſhould be much more, to wit, 66<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 30′.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. No two places can be laid down true in theſe three reſpects, as to their Courſe, Diſtance, and Difference of Longitude, but if you would lay them down true in two of theſe reſpects, whereof there are three Caſes: Firſt, in their Courſe and Diſtance, then the Difference of Latitude will be true, and the Difference of Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude falſe, as in the ſecond Caſe. Secondly, in their Courſe and Difference of Longitude, then will the Diſtance and Difference of Latitude be much more then it ſhould; the Diſtance thus found will be 1860 leagues, and the difference of Latitude 65<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 3′, and ſhould be but 26<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 40′. Thirdly, to lay them down true in their Diſtance and Difference of Longitude, in many Caſes is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and in this Example; but yet where the Difference of Latitude is more then the Difference of Longitude, this may be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119140:52"/> done, but then the Difference of Latitude will always be too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and the Rumbe too wide from the Meridian.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Three places cannot be laid down true, as to their Latitudes, Courſes and Diſtances from each other, though we wave the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude, as ſhall afterwards be ſhewed; from which premiſes we may raiſe theſe conſequences.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That in regard three places cannot be laid down true in their Courſes, Diſtances and Latitudes, although we wave and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Difference of Longitude to be falſe, that it is no ſafe way to make Charts, as generally they are, to be true as to the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of places, and as near the truth as they can as to the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Diſtances, for out of ſuch a falſe Chart a true one cannot be made, nor the true rumbe and diſtance between moſt places found.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it were beſt to make theſe Charts true, as to the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudes and Latitudes of all places, in regard the true rumbe and diſtance may be thence eaſily found, as we ſhall ſhew; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other true Chart or Globe graduated from them, and that in ſtead of putting in ſuch abundance of Compaſſes and Rumbe-lines, both in the <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Mercators Chart,</hi> it were better to leave them out, and to put into ſome ſpare place the Traverſe-quadrant with points and half points, and a Limbe divided into degrees, with a Line of Sines, or elſe the Sines of the points, halfs, and quarters onely.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That being ſo made near the Equinoctial, they are very near the truth, and may there very well ſerve, as alſo under the Meridian, and for ſhort Diſtances or Voyages: and how to take away the Error of the Chart, and make them ſerve for long and remote Voyages ſhall be handled; in order whereto the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the uſe of the <hi>Plain Chart</hi> muſt be repeated.</p>

                        <p>But now, as for finding the Meridional parts between the two former Latitudes, in one or both Hemiſpheres, the middle Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in one Hemiſphere will be 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and the Meridional parts 40<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 00, and in both Hemiſpheres if found at once by the middle Latitude, which is 10<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, is 121<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 85; or if found ſeverally at twice, 140<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 616, which varying from the truth, as above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Sum and Difference, we may conclude, that the Proportion is very unſound and intolerable for any great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Latitude, but Mr. <hi>Gunters</hi> Works deliver no Caution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: Before we can finde the diſtance, the Rumbe muſt be calculated, and if that be falſe, a ſmall error therein may cauſe a conſiderable error in the diſtance.</p>
                        <p>Where the difference of Latitude is not above five degrees, it may ſerve very well near the truth from the Equinoctial to 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of Latitude, and afterwards to 80<hi rend="sup">d</hi>; it will not ſerve for three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees difference of Latitude, and in all Caſes the Coſine of the middle Latitude is a tearm too great, the middle Latitude being too ſmall, and I think no certain Rule can be given to correct it.</p>

                        <p>This he doth not inſiſt upon as abſolutely true, but yet leaves it uncertain when to uſe it, and when not, the half Sum of the Coſines is a tearm ſomewhat near in many Caſes to the Coſine of the middle Latitude, and by the like reaſon this Proportion may be refuted, as that was; the half ſum of the Coſines is a tearm that may very well ſerve near the truth for 10 degrees difference of Latitude, or more between the Latitudes of 20<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, near the Poles it is too great, in which caſe the geometrical mean is truer, near the Equinoctial, and generally in both Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres it is too ſmall; and this I thought fit to adde, that thoſe that uſe geometrical Schemes derived from theſe Proportions, may not be miſ-led, and after a troubleſome manner the Courſe and diſtance in the <hi>Seamans Calendar</hi> is laid down between two places, in effect from this latter Propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And for finding how many miles in any Latitude vary one degree of Longitude (if it were needful) is eaſily performed by the Plain Scale, as I have now contrived it; take the Complement of the Latitude from the greater Scale of Sines, and meaſure it in the greater Scale of leagues or equal parts.</p>

                     <head>How Geometrically to ſupply the Meridian-line of <hi>Mercators Chart</hi> generally.</head>
                     <p>That the finding of the true Rumbe between two places, might not be a Propoſition out of the reach of Geometry, or not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Scale and Compaſſes, the ſupply thereof became the Contemplation of the late learned Mr. <hi>Samuel Forſter</hi> Profeſſor of Aſtronomie in <hi>Greſham Colledge,</hi> who in his Treatiſe of a ruler, Entituled, <hi>Poſthuma Foſteri,</hi> makes a Meridian-line out of a Scale of Secants: this we ſhall be brief in, and ſhew how near it comes to the truth. Let it be required to make a Meridian-line of ſuch a ſcantling, that one degree of Longitude may be half an inch, which is of the ſame ſize with the Print thereof at the end of the Book.</p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:119140:56"/>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>And ſo if it were required to make the Meridian-line from 43<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to 50<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of Latitude, the former extent C F out of the quadrant ſhall reach in this line F L from 43<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to 44, in like manner the Secant of 44<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 30′ ſo taken out, ſhall reach from 44<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to 45.</p>
                     <p>And thus may the whole degrees be taken out, now for dividing them into Centeſmes, they may be equal diviſions, and yet very near the truth; or rather firſt divide the half degrees true by the middle Secant, thus: the half of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant of 49<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 15′, ſhall reach from 49<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to 49<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and a half, and inſtead of halfing the Secant, it may be taken out to half the Radius, and afterwards the parts of each half degree may be divided equally, and ſo if you would divide a degree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ten parts, each part will be 6 minutes; and if it were required to finde the true length of the Meridian-line from 49 degrees to 49 degrees 6 minutes, the tenth part of the middle Secant, to wit, of 49 degrees 3 minutes, ſhall be the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119140:57"/> length required, and ſo on ſucceſſively. And ſo if it were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to finde the length of 49<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 7 tenths, or 42′, I ſay that 7/10 of the middle Secant, to wit, of the Secant of 49 35 Centeſms, or 49<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 21′, is the length required.</p>
                     <p>Now it may be doubted that the making of the Meridian-line by whole degrees, is not near enough the truth, in regard the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at firſt were made by the adding of the Secants of every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute ſucceſſively together; and the learned Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi> in ſtead of adding the Secants of every minute, would have a minute divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into a hundred, a thouſand, ten thouſand, or rather a million of parts, and the Secants of every one of thoſe parts added to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer, That the making of the Meridian-line by whole degrees, and in the whole, doth not breed any error at all to be regarded, compared with the making of it up ſucceſſively by every minute, and for each particular degree it doth not breed any ſenſible error, compared with the beſt Tables.</p>
                     <p>To the end of this Book we have added a Table of the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian-line to every ſecond Centeſm, wherein we have ſupplied the vacuity that is in Mr. <hi>Gunters</hi> Table, by which Table it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the Meridional parts between the Latitudes of 50 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and 60 degrees, are 17<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>542, which other Tables make more; and by the adding up of the Secants of 51 degrees 30 minutes, 52 degrees 30 minutes, and ſo ſucceſſively to 59 degrees 30 minutes they will amount to 17<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 547, the difference being onely in the thouſandth parts of a degree; and I ſuppoſe there are no <hi>Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Charts</hi> made, wherein a degree of Longitude is an inch, the biggeſt, I have ſeen is but half an inch, and if they were an inch it could ſcarcely be divided into one hundred parts, much leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a thouſand, and ſo in every part of the Meridian-line as far as it can be uſed, the difference will be inconſiderable, and ſo alſo in the whole.</p>

                     <p>Now in regard the former way of making the Meridian-line, though true enough, may ſeem to be tedious, as not to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to 80 degrees, without 80 ſeveral additions of thoſe porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or pieces by the Compaſſes, I thought fit to ſupply 8 points on the Scale of equal parts in the Frontiſpiece, which have onely pricks or full points ſet to them, being indeed the Meridian-line for every 10<hi rend="sup">d</hi> from 0 to 80<hi rend="sup">d</hi>; and thus the Reader may ſupply them, making 10<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of thoſe leſſer parts to be Radius, the diſtances of theſe Points from 10<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to 60, are the Secants of the middle La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes between them encreaſed by 15′.</p>

                     <p>The manner of forcing the Meridian-line was thus: Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> Mathematical Inſtrument-maker, having one well made, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided on the edge of a ſquare rod, fitted to half an inch Radius, that is, every degree of Longitude was half an inch, and a larger then that he never made (a Chart made thereto from the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial to 80 degrees of Latitude towards one of the Poles, will require five foot and above nine inches breadth.)</p>
                     <p>I deſired him to paſte white Paper over a large Table, and to divide the Degrees of a Quadrant thereon, drawing lines into the Center, which he accordingly did, and then moving the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian-line rod too and again till we found it would fit, it ſeemed to both our judgements, that it might very well be divided from the degrees of the ſaid Quadrant, according to the Diſtances and Angles here ſet down, if carefully performed; and though this be not Geometrical, yet it may very well ſerve for Sea-mens uſe; and thoſe that may doubt of the truth hereof till they have tried, having one already made, may make another carefully after this manner upon Paper, and then folding the Paper backwards in the lines B, C, D, E, F, lay the folded edges to their graduated line, and finde a good agreement, if performed well.</p>
                     <p>The Meridian-line is of ſuch general uſe in Navigation, that indeed without it, or a Table thereof, the true Rumbe between two places cannot be known, a good Reckoning cannot bee kept, and thereby as <hi>Maetius</hi> well obſerves, the Navigator is in a capacity to ſail unto all the coaſts or corners of the earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     <p>Before we proceed to the Demonſtration of <hi>Mercators Chart,</hi> it will be neceſſary to ſearch into the Nature of the Rumbe-line, on the Globe, and to collect what we finde obſerveable in Forreign Authors to this purpoſe:</p>

They define it to be ſuch a Line that makes the ſame Angles with every Meridian, through which it paſſeth, and therefore can be no Arch of a great Circle; for ſuppoſe ſuch a Circle to paſs through the Zenith of ſome place not under the Equinoctial, making an oblique Angle with the Meridian, then ſhall it make a greater Angle with all other Meridians then with that through which it at firſt paſſeth, therefore the Rumbe which maketh the ſame Angles with every Meridian, muſt needs be a Line curving and bending, which ſome call a <hi>Helix-Line,</hi> and others, becauſe it is ſuppoſed to be on the Surface of the Sphere, a <hi>Heliſpherical-line.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. Another Property of the Rumbe-line, is, that it leads nearer and nearer unto one of the Poles, but never falleth into it, and near the Pole it turneth often round the ſame, in many Spires and turnings.</p>
                     <p>If by any Rumbe (but not under the Meridian) it were ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed poſſible to ſayl directly under the Pole point, it would follow that the Meridian-line of <hi>Mercators Chart</hi> ſhould be finite, and not infinite, and that one and the ſame line ſhould cut infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lines as ſuch, at equal Angles in a meer point, which is againſt the nature and definition of a line, and then ſeeing that the Rumbe derives its definition from the Angle, it makes with the Meridian: the nature and uſe of a Meridia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>For Example:</hi> If a Ship ſayl from the Latitude of 10<hi rend="sup">d</hi> North-Eaſt, till ſhe be in the Latitude of 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and then ſayl from thence on the ſame Rumbe till ſhe be in the Latitude of 50<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, the latter diſtance ſhall be equal to the former diſtance, and the like ſhall

                     <p>It therefore holds:</p>

                     <p>Wherefore if we make the Meridional parts one Leg of a right angled Triangle, and the difference of Longitude the other, the Meridional parts being aſſumed or made Radius, the difference of Longitude becomes the Tangent of the Rumbe, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Angle between the Meridian and Rumbe-Line, or Hipote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſal, meaſureth the quantity of the Rumbe from the Meridian; and this is the very caſe and thing done in <hi>Mercators Chart</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all places, wherefore the truth of that Chart is as much in every reſpect above all contradiction, as the beſt Calculation that is as every was publiſhed, and we may very well conclude with Mr. <hi>Norwood</hi> in his <hi>Trigonometry,</hi> page 119. that all or any parts of the world may be ſet down therein according to their Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, Latitudes, Courſes and Diſtances, as truly and far more conveniently for the Mariners uſe, then upon the Globe it ſelf, with the which elſewhere he ſaith it agrees without ſenſible error; And in the words of its renowned Author Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> we may ſay it agrees therewith without ſenſible or conſiderable error.</p>
                     <p>Now let us ſee what can be objected againſt it: Mr. <hi>Speidel</hi> in his Brief Treatiſe of <hi>Sphaerical Triangles,</hi> page 48 ſaith, <hi>That by Mercators Chart in the bearing of two places, there will appear a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt error of whole degrees, being compared with the Globe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I adde, if this were true, there would alſo ariſe a great error in the diſtance, ſeeing we have nothing but his bare word for it, it is as eaſily here denyed, as there affirmed, and it were to be wiſhed he had left us his minde concerning it; if by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the Globe he means it ſhould be the ſame with the angle of Poſition, this we deny; for the Rumbe makes the ſame Angles with both the Meridians of the places between which it is extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119140:65"/> whereas the Angle of Poſition at one of the places differs from what it is at the other place: And here note, that a Courſe ſayled under the Meridian, or in a Parallel, is not properly called a Rumbe, for under the former the Ships motion deſcribes a great Circle, and in a parallel a leſſer Circle, whereas a Rumbe is no Circle at all, but rather reſembles a Spiral-line.</p>
                     <p>Another Objection may be raiſed from learned Mr. <hi>Oughtreds Treatiſe of Navigation,</hi> page 38. at the end of his Circles of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, wherein he makes this one property of the Rumbe, that a Ship ſayling therein from one place to another, cannot return back to the firſt place by the oppoſite Rumbe: behold the former Scheme wherein in the Triangle <hi>k l m,</hi> ſuppoſe a Ship to ſayl from <hi>k</hi> to <hi>m,</hi> then is <hi>l k m</hi> the Angle of the Rumbe firſt kept, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubtended by the Side <hi>l m;</hi> now if ſhe would ſayl back again from <hi>m</hi> to <hi>k,</hi> the Angle of the Rumbe will be <hi>n m k,</hi> a bigger An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle then the former, becauſe the Side <hi>k n</hi> that ſubtends it, is a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Side, and ſo that if the Ship ſhould ſayl back by the very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Angle, the Ship would not arrive at <hi>k,</hi> but fall wide of it nearer unto <hi>n.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, That this is true in nicety of ſpeculation, for in the right angled Triangle <hi>k l m,</hi> if I give the Side <hi>k l</hi> the difference of Latitude, and the Side <hi>l m</hi> the difference of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude, reduced to the meaſure of that Parallel, I may by theſe finde the Diſtance <hi>k m,</hi> and the Angle of the Rumbe <hi>l k m.</hi> In like manner in the Triangle <hi>m n k,</hi> the Side <hi>m n</hi> is equal to <hi>l k,</hi> but the Side <hi>k n</hi> is greater then <hi>l m,</hi> and is the difference of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude in the given Parallel, whereby we may finde <hi>m k</hi> greater then it was found before, and the Angle of the Rumbe <hi>n m k</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Angle <hi>l k m;</hi> And ſo in the whole number of Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be-Triangles in finding the Rumbe, get the Meridional parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both Latitudes, by ſubſtracting the leſs from the greater, and thereby finde the Rumbe, this findes the leſſer Angle, and includes the moſt Northwardly, and excludes the moſt Southward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parallel.</p>
                     <p>Again, ſubſtract a Centeſm or Minute from each Latitude, and then finde the Meridional parts, whereby calculate the Rumbe: this findes the bigger Angle, and excludes the moſt Northwardly, and includes the moſt Southwardly Parallel; and thus we may
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119140:66"/> finde how much the inward Angle of the Rumbe differs from the outward, between both which the true Rumbe is a mean; but if the caſe be put in different Hemiſpheres, the ſum of the Meridio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts in both Latitudes will finde the leſſer Angle, then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract a minute from the greater, and adde a minute to the leſſer Latitude, and with the ſum of the Meridional parts proper to both Latitudes thus altered, you may alſo finde the greater Angle.</p>
                     <p>The Meridional parts thus found, either way will be ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably different, that there will ſcarce be any ſenſible differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the Rumbe found by each operation, and therefore though the Objection be true in ſpeculation, yet cannot be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in practice, and what difference may thus ariſe, may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to all poſſible nearneſs, if in ſtead of making a Rumbe trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle to every minute, we ſhould divide a Minute or Centeſm into a hundred, a thouſand, ten thouſand, or a million of Triangles, and adde up the Secants of them according to Mr. <hi>Oughtreds</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but we may ſay with Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> page 114. that this were a matter more curious then neceſſary, a Table made to every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute or Centeſm being ſo near the truth, that it is not poſſible by any Rules or Inſtruments of Navigation to diſcover any ſenſible error in the Sea Chart, ſo far forth as it ſhall be made according thereto: Secondly, were the Objection more conſiderable then it is, yet to me it ſeems a groſs abſurdity in practice, to affirm that a Ship cannot return by the oppoſite Rumbe.</p>

                     <p>Suppoſe the points R &amp; Q in the Chart were two Iſlands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I would meaſure the diſtance, ſuppoſing theſe places to be truly placed in the Chart according to their Latitudes and Longitudes, it is neceſſary to find in what Latitudes both places are: thus, if you take the neareſt diſtance from Q to ſome Parallel, to wit, K L, and place it in the Meridian-line T S, the right way from that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel you will find that place to be in the latitude of 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 5 tenths, and the point R will be found to be in the latitude of 24<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 42 cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſms, get the difference of Latitude, which is one degree and 92 Centeſms, which take out of the Scale of Inches, to wit, one inch,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119140:68"/> and 92 hundred parts of another, and lay a Ruler over the two places R Q, and it will croſs the Parallels at the Points K and X, then enter the former extent ſo by the edge of the Ruler, that one foot reſting by it, the other turned about may but juſt touch ſome one of the Parallels in the Chart; thus one foot of the Compaſſes will reſt at Y, and the other being turned about will juſt touch K L, then is the extent K Y the diſtance in degrees, if meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Scale of Inches, to wit, 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 31 Centeſms; and if you meaſure the ſaid extent in the line T W, it gives you the diſtance in leagues, to wit, 46 leagues and a quarter.</p>
                     <p>And if you have the Scale of leagues graduated on the ſloap edge of your Ruler, you may ſee the diſtance without meaſuring any extent; and if the Line of Inches were wanting, you might double the difference of Latitude, and take it out of the Scale T W, and finde the diſtance the ſame.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, if the former extent were ſo entred, that one foot turned about ſhould juſt touch <hi>r</hi> X, the Compaſſes would reſt at Z, and the extent Z X would be the ſame diſtance as before.</p>

                     <p>I ſaid before that we might very well ſpare the Points of the Compaſs and Rumbes, wherewith moſt Chards are filled, and that the Limbe of a Quadrant in ſome ſpare place of the Chard would be of good uſe, in particular for the reſolving of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, yet the defect thereof we thus ſupply.</p>

                     <p>Suppoſe G to be a place in the Latitude of 28<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to meaſure the diſtance thereof from T, with the Sine of 28<hi rend="sup">d</hi> upon <hi>o</hi> as a Center, deſcribe the Ark <hi>q,</hi> and lay the edge of the Ruler ſo as it may lye over the outward edge of that Ark and T, then take the neareſt diſtance from G to the edge of the Ruler, which being turned twice over in the line T W, you will finde the diſtance ſought to be 65 leagues.</p>
                     <p>Now we may apprehend how to lay the Ruler without drawing the Ark <hi>q,</hi> ſo as the Compaſſes turned about may juſt touch the edge thereof, and then ſetting down one foot of the Compaſſes by the ſaid edge, turn the Ruler about that the edge may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards G, and take the neareſt diſtance as aforeſaid to it, and in Latitudes above 40<hi rend="sup">d</hi> or 45<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, the trouble of turning about the Ruler
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119140:69"/> may be beſt ſpared in that Caſe, with the Sine of the Latitudes Complement, ſetting one foot at H, lay the ruler over T, ſo that the other foot turned about may touch the thin ſloap edge thereof, and then take the neareſt diſtance thereto, as before.</p>
                     <p>For places that differ both in Longitude and Latitude, if they bear one from another Eaſt or Weſt within a quarter or half a point, it may be truly alledged, that the way of meaſuring delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the firſt Caſe will be very uncertain, becauſe the Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will run along almoſt in a Parallel to the edge of the ruler, and ſo cut it very obliquely.</p>

                        </gap>tent C A was tripled to F, and the extent D B was tripled to G, as was declared in that Scheme.</p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, The diſtance may be alſo found as here in the ſecond Caſe, by the Coſine of the middle Latitude between both places.</p>
                     <p>And thus if it were required to finde the diſtance between the points <hi>d</hi> and <hi>f</hi> in the former Chart, by this rule it would be found to be 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 98 Centeſms, which turned twice over in the Scale T W, is 59 leagues 7 tenths, which is not the true diſtance, becauſe the Rumbe between theſe places is above a Point from the Eaſt or Weſt, whereas the true diſtance is 60 leagues 9 tenths; and in this Example the difference of Latitude is 63 Centeſms, and though it were four degrees or more, we might firſt finde the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by the Coſine of the middle Latitude, and then enlarge it by entring it ſo by the edge of the ruler laid over the two places, that one foot reſting by the ſloap edge, the other turned about might but juſt touch ſome Meridian, in ſtead of a Parallel in the former way.</p>
                     <p>Thus a ruler laid over <hi>d</hi> and <hi>f</hi> cuts the Meridian-line at <hi>u,</hi> and the former extent ſo entred, one foot of it will reſt at <hi>m,</hi> while the other turned about will but juſt touch T S, then the extent <hi>m u</hi> turned twice over and meaſured in the line T W, will be 60 leagues 9 tenths the Diſtance required, the enlargement thus found being but very ſmall as to matter of extent.</p>

                     <p>Now we may take a view of what Rules have been formerly delivered for the Meaſuring of Diſtances, here we need not recite Mr. <hi>Gunters</hi> way, which is not onely troubleſom, as not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without two Pair of Compaſſes, but alſo uncertain, if the Diſtance be great.</p>
                     <p>The Way in uſe amongſt Seamen is to take half of the whole extent between any two places in the Chart, and either to ſet one foot of the Compaſſes down in the Meridian-line, at the middle Arch, which is the middle Latitude between both places, or at the middle ſpace or juſt half between the Latitudes of both places, which always falls ſomewhat nearer the Pole then the middle La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and then turn the other foot of the Compaſſes both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and downwards, and minde what Arks it croſſeth in the Meridian-line, then they count the whole Arch contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the places where the moveable foot ſo croſſed, and take that for the whole diſtance ſought.</p>

So alſo when you would meaſure the tenth part of a great diſtance, meaſure the whole extent in the Scale of Longitudes, and take the twentieth part found by the pen or memory, out of the ſaid Scale, and ſet it at the middle Latitude, or middle Space, turning the other foot in the Meridian-line, both upwards and downwards, and the degrees ſo intercepted, will be the tenth part of the whole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.

                     <p>The former Scheme, albeit it may be demonſtrated from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Sphaere, yet it may be more eaſily and ſpeedily done

                     <p>The Arch G E in the former Scheme, is one of the Vertical Angles, or half the difference of Longitude for two places in the Latitude of 50<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, whoſe difference of Longitude is 70<hi rend="sup">d</hi>: the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſtance from E to Q R, is the Coſine of half the difference of Longitude, making Q G Radius, which by conſtruction is made equal to the Tangent of 50<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, the common Latitude to another Radius, wherefore by reaſon of the Proportion of Equality, the Coſine of any Ark from the Perpendicular to the former Radius, to wit, the neareſt diſtance from <hi>a</hi> to Q R, being the Coſine of 5<hi rend="sup">d</hi> difference of Longitude from the Perpendicular, is therefore equal to the Tangent of the Arks Latitude ſought, to the latter Radius, proper to the given difference of Longitude, wherefore the Proportion is duly obſerved.</p>
                     <p>When the Obliquity or greateſt Latitude is very great, it will be inconvenient to draw it the former way, this commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens when places differ much in Latitude, but little in Longitude, however generally places may be laid down otherwiſe on the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Projection.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Nota,</hi> if a line of ſines equal to the diameter be graduated on the floap edge of a ruler, the ſines in the line B I may be eaſily pricked
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119140:86"/> down with the pen, by the edge thereof without Compaſſes, and the Arkes in the under Semicircle B A, may be readily meaſured by view, by laying the beginning of that line of Sines to the point B, and moving the edge of the ruler to each reſpective Ark before found in the ſaid Semicircle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Here note,</hi> that a Semicircle being divided into 90 equal parts, the diſtances of each degree from one end of the Diameter, are Sines of thoſe Arkes, the whole Diameter being their Radius, wherefore the uſe of Sines is as Geometrical as the uſe of Chords.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame Scheme the Reader may firſt finde the Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and then the Diſtances on each ſide of it, by Proportions before ſet down.</p>

                     <p>Admit in this latter Proportion it were required to produce the fourth tearm ſo, as that it ſhould be the whole difference of the Sines of the Extream Arches, then muſt half the Radius be the firſt tearm, being equal to the Sine of 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, which is the Coſine of 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and therefore if we make the middle Arch 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, by reaſon of the Proportion of equality in the two firſt tearms, it follows that the Sine of the Ark of Diſtance of either of the extreams from 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, is equal to the difference of the Sines of thoſe extream Arches, and conſequently having all the Sines under 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi> made, all the reſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it are made by Addition onely: for inſtance, the Sine of 10<hi rend="sup">d</hi> is equal to the difference of the Sines of 50<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and of 70<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and therfore being added to the Sine of 50<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, ſhal make the Sine of 70<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe in the former of thoſe Proportions, if you would have the laſt tearm to be the ſum of the Sines of the Extreams, half the Radius muſt be the firſt tearm, and then making the mean or middle Arch to be 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, by reaſon of the Proportion of equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between the Sine thereof and of half the Radius, it follows that the Coſine of the Ark of Diſtance of either of the extreams from 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, is equal to the ſum of the Sines of thoſe extream Arches, from which taking the leſſer of thoſe Sines, the remainder is the greater; hence it follows that if the Sines of the firſt and laſt 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of the Quadrant be given, from them all the Sines between 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi> may be made by ſubſtraction.

                  <head>OF THE SCALE Uſed in this Book.</head>
                  <p>THough this Treatiſe bears the name of <hi>the Mariners Plain Scale new Plain'd,</hi> yet the Scale intended thereby, is cut in the Frontis-piece of the firſt Book.</p>
                  <p>Nothing more is neceſſarily required in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of this Book, then from the commonly known Diviſion of a Circle into 360 equal parts, called Degrees, to prick down any number of Degrees leſs then 180<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and a quadrant divided into nine equal parts, and one of thoſe parts for convenience below the Diamater into 10 Sub-diviſions, called Degrees, may very well ſerve the turn, which the Readers ingenuity will furniſh himſelf withal in any place, if he have but Compaſſes, yet for expedition a line of Sines is often made uſe of.</p>
                  <p>In the following Diagram, the equal Diviſions of the Semicircle, are transferred into the line of Chords in the Diameter, by ſetting one foot of the Compaſſes in A, which is called the leſſer Chord.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Chords being numbred by the half Arches, to which they belong, become a line of Sines of the ſame Radius with the Diameter of the Semicircle, and are called the greater Sines.</p>
                  <p>To that Radius there is fitted a Chord of 60 <hi rend="sup">d</hi>, called the greater Chord, that the Reader might be ſupplyed with both, for the leſſer Chord will not ſerve to prick off an Arch in a Circle of twice the Radius whereto it is fitted, unleſs the ſaid Chord be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in a right line before it be pircked into the Circumference.</p>
                  <p>The Sines to the Chord in the Diameter, are graduated on the Radius or line C B, by drawing lines thorough each degree of the quadrants AB, DB, and are called the leſſer Sines.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo added a Scale of equal parts and Rumbes for other Protractions, but we uſe neither of them in this Book.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:119140:104"/>
                  <p>The Schemes in the Book are fitted either to the leſſer or greater Chord here deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Every degree of a Line of Sines, or Chords, we ſuppoſe to be divided into 60 parts, which we call minutes, which in the following Operations are gueſſed at, for a ſmall Inſtrument will not admit of ſo many Sub-diviſions.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Sphaerical Definitions.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>BEfore we proceed to the Reſolution of any particular queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it will be neceſſary to premiſe the common Spherical Definitions, and to ſhew how the Analemma repeſents them.</p>
                     <p>The word Sphere, though, as <hi>Herigonius</hi> ſheweth, it be taken in a fourfold ſenſe, yet I think it not neceſſary to define above two of them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Therefore a Sphere may, according to <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be a ſolid Superficies, or round Body, contained under one Surface, in the middle whereof there is a point whence all right lines drawn unto the Circumference, are equal, and is made by the turning round of half a Circle, till it end where it began.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:119140:104"/>2. It is taken for a certain round Inſtrument conſiſting of divers Circles, whereby the motions of the Heavens, and the Scituation of the whole World, is moſt conveniently repreſented.</p>
                     <p>For the better explanation whereof, Aſtronomers do imagine, 10 Principal points, and 10 Circles to be in the hollow inſide of the firſt moveable Sphere, which are commonly drawn upon any Globe or Sphere, beſides divers other Circles which are not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated, but onely apprehended in the fancy.</p>
                     <p>The Points are the two Poles of the World, the two Poles of the Zodiack, the two Equinoctial points, the two Solſtitial points, and the Zenith and Nadir.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Poles of the World</hi> are two points, which are Diametrically, or directly oppoſite to one another, about which the whole frame of Heaven moveth from the Eaſt into the Weſt, whereof one is perpetually ſeen by us, and is called the Arctick, or North Pole.</p>
                     <p>The other being hid from us, and directly oppoſite to the former, is called the Antarctick, or South pole, a right line imagined to be drawn from the one Pole to the other, is called the Axis, or Axeltree of the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Axis</hi> differs from the Diameter, becauſe that every right line drawn through the Center of the Sphere, and limited on each ſide of the Surface of the Sphere, is a Diameter; but not an Axis, unleſs the Sphere move round about it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Poles of the Zodiack,</hi> are two points Diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, upon which the Heavens move from the Weſt into the Eaſt, one of them is towards the North, diſtant from the Arctick or North Pole, 23 degrees 31 minutes; the other is towards the South, and is as much diſtant from the South Pole.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A Degree</hi> is the 360<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of any whole Circle, and a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute is the 60<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of a Degree, but of late ſome divide a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree into 100 parts, which are called Centeſmes, or Centeſimal Minutes, in defining ſome of the Points we muſt refer to Circles afterwards to be defined.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Equinoctial Points</hi> are in the beginnings of <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Libra,</hi> to which when the Sun cometh, he makes the day and night of an equal length throughout the whole World, to wit, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Aries</hi> about the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> which is accounted the

                           <p>The Horizon is diſtinguiſhed by the names of Rational or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the Rational Horizon is a great Circle every where equidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Zenith, and divides the upper Hemiſphere from the lower, and by accident or chance, is diſtinguiſhed by the names of a right Oblique and parallel Horizon.</p>
                           <p>A right Horizon is ſuch a Horizon as paſſeth through each Pole
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119140:105"/> of the World, and cuts the Equinoctial at right Angles, whence the Inhabitants under the Equinoctial, are ſaid to have a right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, and a right Sphere.</p>
                           <p>An Oblique Horizon is ſuch a one as cuts the Equinoctial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, or aſlope.</p>
                           <p>A parallel Horizon is not ſuch a one as cuts the Equinoctial, but is coincident, and is the ſame therewith, and ſuch is the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon under the Poles.</p>
                           <p>The ſenſible Horizon is a Circle dividing that part of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens which we ſee, from that part which ſee not, thence called Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor.</p>
                           <p>From the Accidental Scituation of the Horizon, follows many conſequences.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Thoſe that live in a right Horizon, that is under the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial, have their days and nights always of an equal length, to them all the Stars both riſe and ſet, twice in a year the Sun paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through their Zenith, conſequently they have two Summers and two Winters, to wit, Summers when the Sun paſſeth through their Zenith; and Winters when he is in or near the Tropicks.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. In any right or Oblique Sphere, the length of the day when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, is equal to the length of the night.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. In any Oblique Sphere, the nearer the Sun approacheth to the Viſible Pole, the longer are the Days more then the Nights, ſome Stars always appear, others never appear, and the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Equinoctial, the greater is the number of ſuch Stars, and the more inequality is there between the Days and Nights.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. To thoſe that live under the Polar Circles, their day once a year is 24 hours long, and their Night nothing.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Under the Pole, one half of the Sphere doth always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and the other half not appear, and one half of the year is well nigh continually Day, and the other half continually Night, becauſe the Equinoctial lies in the Horizon; 'Tis ſaid well nigh, for by reaſon of the Suns Excentricity, the day under the North Pole, is longer then the Night, about eight days; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary under the South Pole, is ſhorter then the night as many days.</p>

                        <p>Then will the new Latitude be 52<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 27′,</p>
                        <p>And the new Altitude 13<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 00.</p>
                        <p>I ſay, the Azimuth is the ſame as it is in the Latitude of 13<hi rend="sup">d</hi> when the Altitude is 52<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 27′. Alſo the hour from noon in the new Latitude, is equal to the angle of Poſition in the old Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119140:122"/> and the angle of Poſition in the new Latitude, is equal to the hour from noon in the old Latitude.</p>
                        <p>The old or firſt Scheme may very well ſerve if you ſet off 70<hi rend="sup">d</hi> the complement of the Declination each way from A, the end of the parallel of Altitude, and then through the point P, draw the parallel of Altitude parallel to the Horizon.</p>
                        <p>But here we have drawn a ſecond Scheme, where N P is 52<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 27′, P D and P E 70<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, thorough which points are drawn the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel D E; Alſo S B and N A is 13<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, thorough which is drawn the parallel B A, then is F <g ref="char:circdot">⊙</g> the Sine of the Suns Azimuth to the Northwards of the Eaſt, to the Radius F A which is placed from C to G, upon which with F <g ref="char:circdot">⊙</g>, was the Arch I deſcribed, and the Azimuth S L found to be 16<hi rend="sup">d</hi> as before.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nota,</hi> alſo in the firſt Scheme (or in both) that the Radius C G might have been doubled, and pricked upon N S produced, then alſo muſt the extent F <g ref="char:circdot">⊙</g> have been doubled, and the Arch I therewith deſcribed; alſo, the hour of the day might after the ſame manner be found in the parallel of Latitude which may be convenient for Stars that have much Declination in that Caſe, the Declination and Latitude muſt change Names.</p>
                        <p>And thus when three ſides are given to finde an angle, we may find it in the Analemma, by calling the complements of thoſe ſides the Declination, the Latitude, and the Altitude, or Depreſſion at pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>Alſo when three Angles are given to finde a ſide, thoſe Angles muſt be changed into ſides, by taking the complement of the greateſt Angle to a Semicircle, and writing it, and the other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles down to their oppoſite ſides in another Triangle, as in the Scheme following, wherein as the angles are changed into ſides; ſo are the ſides changed into angles, and then the Caſe will be the ſame as before.</p>

                        <p>And let it be required to finde the Suns reſpective Altitudes to the Azimuths of 20<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, on each ſide from the Vertical Circle. Upon the Center C, deſcribe an arch bigger then a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle, and draw the Horizontal Line S C N, and its Axis Z C at right angles thereto, and ſet off the Latitudes from S to A, and draw the parallel thereof L A, ſet off the Declination likewiſe from N to E, and draw the parallel thereof D E, which is eaſily done by pricking off the like arch above S.</p>
                        <p>Now to proportion out the Sines to the Radius A L, draw the Line A C, and there prick down the Sines of 20<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and take the neareſt diſtances therefrom to the line C Z, and transfer or place thoſe reſpective extents into the parallel of Latitude L A, pricking them down from L, then one foot of the Compaſſes reſting in C, take the diſtance to 20<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi> in the parallel of Latitude L A, and transfer or place them into the parallel of Declination D E, and there number them, as before, then take the diſtance between the Zenith at Z, and 20<hi rend="sup">d</hi> in the parrallel of Latitude L A, and the ſaid extent ſhall reach from 20<hi rend="sup">d</hi> in the parallel of Declination D E, to F upward, and to H downwards.</p>

                        <p>The ark N Q being 59<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 21′, is the Suns height for 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of Azimuth to the ſouthwards of the Eaſt or Weſt, and the ark N R being 9<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 43′, is the Suns depreſſion in Summer for 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth to the northwards of the Eaſt or Weſt; It is alſo his Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Altitude for 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of Azimuth from Eaſt or Weſt ſouthwards, when his Declination is 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 31′ ſouth, which is as much as we ſuppoſed it to be north.</p>
                        <p>The ground of the former Scheme, is, that the Sun in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel of Altitude hath the like diſtance from the Zenith, as in his parallel of Declination, alſo his diſtance from the Center in his parallel of Altitude, is the ſame with his diſtance from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his parallel of Declination, whence follows another Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neation of the Analemma ſuitable to this caſe, for we may place the parallel of Declination parallel to the Horizon, which now muſt repreſent the Equinoctial, then if the Sine of the Azimuth be prickt down in any given parallel of Altitude, the diſtance of that point from the Center and Zenith are both given, then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Sun to have the like diſtance in his parallel of Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Center, as he had in his parallel of Latitude: and moreover, if from the ſaid point his diſtance from the Zenith in his parallel of Altitude be applied upward, it wil give the Latitude or Zenith ſought, from the Horizontal line repreſenting the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial, and by the bare change of names, if the Sines of the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Azimuths be prickt down in the parallel of Latitude, the reſpective Zeniths will become the Altitudes ſought. See page 38 to this purpoſe. And the ſame Zenith diſtance and Center di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, is common to Azimuths as much remote on the other ſide the Vertical, wherefore the Scheme findes both.</p>

Having drawn the Parallel of Latitude A L 51<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 32′, and therein proportioned out the Sine of 40<hi rend="sup">d</hi> L B, to the Radius L A, prick off the Declination of that Star from N to E, being 56<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 45′, and place the neareſt diſtance from E to N C, from C to D, and draw the Parallel D E, then one foot of the Compaſſes reſting in C, place the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance C B into the Parallel of Declination at G, then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Z B will reach from G to F upwards, and to H downwards.</p>
                        <p>The arch S F being 80<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 50′, is the greater Altitude that the Star ſhall have upon that Azimuth, and N H 45<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 3′ is the leſſer Altitude: and here obſerve, that ſuch Stars as have more decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation then the complement of the Latitude, never riſe nor ſet; if their declination be alſo more then the latitude of the place, they will have two altitudes or heights on every Azimuth from the Meridian, except the remoteſt.

                        <p>Having deſcribed a Circle S Z N, and drawn the Horizon S C N, the Axis or Vertical Z C B, prick off the Poles height or latitude from N to P, and from P ſet off 66<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 29′, the Suns Polar diſtance being the complement of the Declination to D and E, and draw the Parallel D E. Prick down the Sine of the given Azimuth 30<hi rend="sup">d</hi> out of the Sines from C to G, and from G draw B G parallel to D E, and joyn S B produced or continued, then thorough the Point F, draw the Line H A parallel to S B, then is the arch S A 49<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 56′, the Suns Altitude for the Azimuth of 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi> from the South, and the arch N H being 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 36′, is the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119140:129"/> Suns height for the Azimuth of 60<hi rend="sup">d</hi> from the North. If H had fallen below N, then had the arch H N been the ark of the Suns depreſſion under the Horizon, proper to the Azimuth given from the Eaſt or Weſt northwards.</p>
                        <p>It had alſo been the Suns height for the like Declination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſouth Pole, proper to the like Azimuth counted from the Eaſt or Weſt ſouthwards, ſo that there needs no Scheme for South Declinations.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nota,</hi> The excellency of this way further appears in this, that if the Azimuth we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The ſame manner of Operation alſo holds for the Sun or Stars when their Declination is more then the Latitude, in which caſe the Parallel of Declination will not croſs the line C Z within the Circle, but muſt be produced to cut the line C Z continued without the Circle above Z, and then a line from the Interſection F happening without, being drawn parallel to S B, will paſs through the quadrant Z N in two points, which ſhall be the two Altitudes required, when it ſo happens. And here note, that if C G had been pricked towards N, then B would have fallen as much above C, as it doth in the former Example below it, from which point B a line muſt be drawn to N in ſtead of S, which will be parallel to S B; and therefore a line drawn parallel thereto paſſing through F, ſhall as well give the Altitudes required, as it did before; wherefore when the diſtance between A and F is but ſmall, though the point F happen within, yet the operation will be moſt certain to place C G on the other ſide the Vertical.</p>
                        <p>But here we muſt prevent an inconvenience, for in ſmall La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes when the Declination towards the elevated Pole is more then the Latitude, the parallel of Declination will not meet with the Vertical or Axis of the Horizon, but at a remote or inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient diſtance.

                        <p>Or it may be expreſſed in two Proportions, thus:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>As the difference of the Sines of both the given Altitudes,</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Is to the Coſine of the greater Altitude:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>So is the Sine of the Azimuth (from the Eaſt) thereto belonging, to a fourth number.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>As the difference of the Sines of both the given Altitudes,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Is to the Coſine of the leſſer Altitude:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>So is the Sine of the Azimuth thereto belonging, to a ſeventh number.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Sum of the fourth and ſeventh Numbers, when the Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muths fall on different ſides the Vertical; but their difference
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119140:136"/> when they happen on the ſame ſide, is equal to the Tangent of the Latitude.</p>
                        <p>Or it may be thus delivered:</p>
                        <p>Multiply the Coſine of each Altitude by the Sine of the Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth thereto belonging, and there will ariſe two Products, the ſum of theſe Products when the Azimuths happen on different ſides, but the difference of them when they happen on the ſame ſide the Vertical, divide by the difference of the Sines of both the given Altitudes, and the Quotient will be the Tangent of the Latitude ſought. This ſuppoſeth the Operations to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the natural Tables of Sines and Tangents.</p>
                        <p>Now having the Latitude, either of the Altitudes with the Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth theteto belonging, we have two Sides and the Angle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended given, to finde the third Side, whereby is found the Declination required.</p>

                  <head>SPHERICAL TRIANGLES Solved by PROJECTION.</head>
                  <p>A Sphaerical Triangle is ſuppoſed to be deſcribed on the Surface or Convexity of the Sphaere.</p>
                  <p>The ſides of a Sphaerical Triangle, are the Arches of three great Circles of the Sphaere mutually interſecting each other.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe are ſaid to be great Circles which biſect or divide the Sphaere in halfs.</p>
                  <p>A Sphaerical Angle (being the arch of Inclination between two Circles of the Sphaere) is meaſured by the arch of a great Circle deſcribed on the Angular point, as a Center between the ſides, being extended to Quadrants.</p>
                  <p>Every Sphaerical Triangle is compoſed of three ſides, and three angles oppoſed thereto, any three of which ſix parts being given, the reſt may be diſcovered by Projection, and is the ſubject of the following Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>The Pole of a Circle is a point in the Surface of the Sphaere, diſtant always 90<hi rend="sup">d</hi> from the Circumference of that Circle to which it belongs, from whence it follows that all right lines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Circumference of the ſaid Circle, are equal.</p>
                  <p>Any two Lines ſo drawn, contain an Angle between them, meaſured by the Arch or Circumference to which they belong. By help of this Pole point, the ſides of Sphaerical Triangles in all the following Propoſitions are meaſured.</p>
                  <p>A Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>By helps of ſuch Repreſentations of the Sphaere on a Plain, the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119140:140"/> ſame Concluſions are performed on a Flat, as upon the Sphaere or Globe it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>A Sphaerical Triangle is either right angled, or oblique angled; a right angled Sphaerical Triangle hath one right angle at the leaſt, the meaſure of a right Angle being always a quadrant or 90<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, the Sides about or including the right Angle, are called <hi>Sides</hi> or <hi>Legs;</hi> and the Side ſubtending the ſame, is called the <hi>Hipotenuſal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe theſe Triangles are more eaſily reſolved then the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, we ſhall firſt handle the ſixteen Caſes thereof, and then proceed to the twelve remaining Caſes of oblique angled Sphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Triangles.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119140:155"/> which here we found by entring one foot of that extent in that ark, ſo that the other turned about, would but juſt touch V R: Having diſcovered the point B, through it draw B O parallel to E C, then take the neareſt diſtance from C to R V, and place it in the Line O B from P, on that ſide thereof which is fartheſt from R V, here we placed it from P to M, then from the Center draw a line paſſing through the point M, as doth V X, and it ſhall be the Meridian Line required.</p>
                        <p>Through the point O draw V D, and the arch N D ſhews the Declination of the Plain to be 40<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and the extent V O is the Coſine of the Latitude; Or through the point B draw G B L pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to V N, and the arch N L is the meaſure of the Latitude of the place, to wit, 51<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 32′.
